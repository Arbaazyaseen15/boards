# Boards Application

This is a simple discussion boards application built with Django. Users can create boards, topics within boards, and posts within topics. The application enforces specific relationships between boards, topics, posts, and users.

## Models

### Board

```python
from django.db import models

class Board(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30, unique=True)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

### Topic

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Topic(models.Model):
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    board = models.ForeignKey(Board, related_name='topics', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    starter = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='topics', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

### Post

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Post(models.Model):
    message = models.TextField(max_length=4000)
    topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, related_name='posts', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='posts', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    updated_by = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, related_name='+', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

## Model Relationships

### Topic and Board Association

A Topic must be associated with exactly one Board (which means it cannot be null), and a Board may be associated with many Topics or none (0..*). This means a Board may exist without a single Topic.

### Topic and Post Association

A Topic should have at least one Post (the starter Post), and it may also have many Posts (1..*). A Post must be associated with one, and only one Topic (1).

### Topic and User Association

A Topic must have one, and only one User associated with it: the topic starter User (1). A User may have many or none Topics (0..*).

### Post and User Association

A Post must have one, and only one User associated with it: created by (1). A User may have many or none Posts (0..*). The second association between Post and User is a direct association, meaning we are interested only in one side of the relationship which is what User has edited a given Post. The multiplicity says 0..1, meaning the updated by field may be null (the Post wasnâ€™t edited) and at most may be associated with only one User.
